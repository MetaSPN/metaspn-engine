# Security

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

- **Preferred:** Open a private security advisory on GitHub: [Security Advisories](https://github.com/metaspn/metaspn-engine/security/advisories/new).
- **Alternative:** Email **leo@metaspn.network** with a description of the issue and steps to reproduce. Please do not open a public issue for security-sensitive bugs.

## What to expect

- We will acknowledge your report and work to confirm the issue.
- We will keep you updated on progress and any planned fix or advisory.
- We credit reporters in advisories unless they prefer to remain anonymous.

## Scope

This project is a minimal signal-processing engine library. Please report:

- Issues that could lead to denial of service, data exposure, or remote code execution when the library is used as intended.
- Supply-chain or build-related concerns that affect the integrity of the package.

We do not consider theoretical issues with no practical impact or issues in dependent projects that are not under our control.
